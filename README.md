# file-freshener
Update your fies once they have been modified

There's not too much to this utility so far.

You add files like: `file-freshener -insert <filename> [-dangerous]?`.
The dangerous flag tells the utility to make sure that you are prompted when you invoke the freshen command(this might be good for system configuration files in a git repo or something).
